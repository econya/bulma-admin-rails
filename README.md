# Bulma-Admin-Rails

Very basic Rails5 app to showcase font-awesome, bulma and the bulma-admin template.

Most parts of the layout are taken from the [bulma-admin template](https://github.com/mazipan/bulma-admin-dashboard-template).

## Assets

* [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.io) via https://github.com/bokmann/font-awesome-rails
* [bulma](https://bulma.io) via https://rails-assets.org/#/components/bulma
* [bulma-admin template](https://github.com/mazipan/bulma-admin-dashboard-template), obviously modified
